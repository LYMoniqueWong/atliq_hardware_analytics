# Project Overview
AtliQ Hardware’s leadership needed faster, smarter, data‑informed decisions across international markets and product lines. Therefore, I:
- Modeled a schema with dim_customer, dim_product, and multiple fact_ tables.
- Wrote 10 SQL queries using CTEs, window functions, and aggregation to answer business‑critical questions.
- Translated raw numbers into clear, actionable insights for executives.
